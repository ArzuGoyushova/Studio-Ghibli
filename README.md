Studio Ghibli Website is a comprehensive digital platform built to provide Ghibli fans with a captivating and immersive experience. Explore the enchanting world of Studio Ghibli films, book tickets for Ghibli-themed events, read Ghibli-related blogs, play games, and interact with Ghibli characters in a chatbot. The website offers easy navigation, user-friendly features, and a fully controllable admin panel for administrators.

The front-end of the website is developed using React and Vite, providing a smooth and responsive user interface. We utilized the Tailwind CSS framework for streamlined styling, ensuring an engaging and visually appealing design.

The back-end of the website is powered by ASP.NET Core 6, functioning as an API to serve data to the client side (React). This architecture enables seamless data transfer and efficient communication between the server and client.

SQL database is implemented to store and manage data efficiently. This relational database ensures data integrity and robustness for the entire platform.
